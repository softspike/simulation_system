Overview
A simulation system processing 10000 tasks with 3 processors.

Features
This system acquires tasks from the database and stores them in a queue which was built with linked list.

The system check on the task IDs is carried out using Regular Expressions.

At each step of the simulation, the simulation clock is updated to the next significant event, e.g.,task arrival, task processing completion.

"simulation_data.py" randomly generates a simulation data, according to certain criterias. A simulation dataset contains 10000 tasks. The code stores the dataset in sqlite3.

Setup & Installation (run in terminal shell)
1.Run "simulation_data.py" first to generate a dataset that contains 10000 tasks, (test2.db is created).

2.Then run "simulation.py" to process the tasks.
